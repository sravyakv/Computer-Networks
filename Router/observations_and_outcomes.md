## Configuring RIP Routing Protocol in Routers
<ul>
<li><h3>A toplogy was created using three Routers and two PCs PC connected as shown in the figure</h3><br>

</li>
<li><h3>Router interfaces were configured using the command: ip address address subnet_mask</h3></li>
<li><h3>Encapsulation ppp and clock rates were specified as required</h3></li>
<li><h3>RIP routing protocol was configured using the command: router rip as shown in the figures below</h3></li>

### Learning outcomes
<ul>
<li>Creating a topology with three routers connected via serial DCE connections and 2 PCs.</li>
<li>Configuring router interfaces using encapsulation ppp and clock rate as required</li>
<li>Configuring RIP routing protocol in routers.</li>
<li>Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a dynamic routing protocol which uses hop count as a routing metric to find the best path between the source and the destination network.</li>
<li>On proper configuration of rip routing protocol in routers, pinging gives the required response.</li>
</ul>
