## Configuring IP address to Routers in Packet Tracer and exploring Ping Responses

<ul>
<li>A toplogy was created using Router-PT and two PC's connected to the router using copper cross-over connections</li>
<li>Different default gateways were configured for both the PC's .</li>
<li>A unique IP address was configured for each PC.</li>
<li>IP adrres was configured for interfaces fa0/0 and fa1/0 using CLI</li>
<li>PC1 was pinged from PC0 using the command prompt</li>
<li>A simple PDU was stimulated by sending ICMP packet from PC0 to PC1</li>
</ul>
