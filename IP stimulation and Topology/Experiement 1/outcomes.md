## Creating a topology and simulating a simple PDU using hub and switch as connecting devices

<ul>
<li>A toplogy was created using Hub-PT and Switch-PT as connecting devices and two PC's connected to hub and switch using copper straight-through and copper cross-over connections</li>
<li>A default gateway was configured.</li>
<li>A unique IP address was configured for each PC.</li>
<li>An ICMP packet was transferred from source to destination via Hub and Switch as connecting devices</li>
</ul>

### Learning Outcomes
<ul>
<li>Creating a topology.</li>
<li>Configuring default gateway and ip address.</li>
<li>Hub is a broadcasting device which forwards the packets to all the devices connected.</li>
<li>Switch is an intelligent device which forwards the packets to only the intended destination.</li>
<li>The device decision is to Encapsulate in layers 3 and 2 and Transmit in layer 1</li>
<li>Simulation of sending a simple PDU from source to destination</li>
</ul>
