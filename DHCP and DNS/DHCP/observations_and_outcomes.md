### Learning outcomes
<ul>
<li>Creating a topology with router, switch, server and PCS.</li>
<li>Configuring the server.</li>
<li>4 steps in DHCP</li>
<ul>
<li>D - Discover the server</li>
<li>O - Offer the IP address</li>
<li>R - Request ip</li>
<li>A - Acknowledgement</li>
</ul>
<li>Individual PC request the Server for an ip address</li>
<li>An ip address is assigned to the PC from a pool of IP addresses by the DHCP server</li>
</ul>
