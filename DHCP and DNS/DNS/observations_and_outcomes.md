### Learning outcomes
<ul>
<li>Creating a topology with switch, server and PC.</li>
<li>Using HTTP services.</li>
<li>Configuring the web server.</li>
<li>Configuring DNS services so that we can use the name instead of ip address.</li>
<li>Using the name or the ip address in the web browser of PC gives the required result.</li>
